                            JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.

                            There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data. MongoDB offers an API library that runs within a Nodejs application to give you programmatic access to MongoDB so you can create databases and then add, query, update or delete data from the MongoDB database.

                            <Card.Text>
                            SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

                            <Card.Text>
                            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
